# Data Collector for MCP (SMASUP)

To analyze problems on a client system, the Data Collector utility collects debug information on an MCP machine. Following data collection, you must FTP the container files (i.e., three output files) to a Windows machine. Then, zip these files and place them in your directory on SMA Technologies' ftp site. Notate in the Salesforce case comment that the files have been uploaded and are available for further analysis. For more information, refer to [Problem Resolution and Debugging](/debugging).
