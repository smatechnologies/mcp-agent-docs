# Configuration Settings

## Run the Manager Program

1. From the home position of any MCP window, type ?ON SMAMGRxxx and transmit.

2. You will be presented the Main Menu. To modify the LSAM configuration, use choices GEN, COMM, VAR, and OPT.

:::info Note

Most of the configuration fields are dynamic; however, each LSAM component must be notified that the configuration file has changed in order to effect the changes. The "Max number concurrent jobs" variable is never changed. To implement a new max jobs count, stop and restart the LSAM to apply the new max job count settings. For more information on applying changes to all other configuration values, refer to [Dynamic LSAM Configuration](/additional-features/lsam-features/dynamic-lsam-configuration).
