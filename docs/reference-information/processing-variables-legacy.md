# Processing Variables (Legacy)

| Field | Default | Valid Values | Description |
| ----- | ------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Max number concurrent jobs | 10 | 1 – 500 | This field specifies the maximum number of jobs the LSAM is allowed to process concurrently. <br></br><br></br> - When changing the value of this field, the configuration program displays the following message at the bottom of the screen: ```MAX JOBS changed - Remove *SMA/CP/MCS/= files``` <br></br><br></br> Transmit "M" after receiving the warning message to confirm the change Refer to [Update the "Max Number Concurrent Jobs" Field](../configuration/update-max-concurrent-jobs) for additional procedures required to change this parameter. |
| Task level checking | N | - N <br></br> - I <br></br> - T | This field enables/disables the checking of a job's subordinate tasks to determine and to display the job's status in Enterprise Manager Operation. <br></br><br></br> **Note**: Regardless of this setting, a task is always tested for a FailCode/Reset match. <br></br><br></br> - If N, the LSAM does not perform Task-Level Checking. <br></br> - If I, the LSAM fails the job immediately upon failure of a subordinate task. <br></br> - If T, the LSAM sets the JOB TO BE FAILED internal flag upon failure of a subordinate task. A Fail Reset match resets the JOB TO BE FAILED flag to "N". |
| Fail immediately on FailCode | N | - Y <br></br> - N | This field determines the LSAM's behavior upon a Fail Code match for either a task or a job. <br></br><br></br> - If Y, the LSAM immediately fails the jobs upon a Fail Code match. <br></br> - If N, the LSAM sets the JOB TO BE FAILED internal flag to "Y" upon a Fail Code match. A Fail Reset match resets the JOB TO BE FAILED flag to "N".
| Task completion message | F | - F <br></br> - A <br></br> - N | This field determines if and when an LSAM sends a task completion message. <br></br><br></br> **Note**: Task-level resource utilization statistics will be returned only if and when a task completion message is sent. For more information on resource utilization statistics, refer to Resource Utilization Statistics. <br></br><br></br> - If F, the LSAM sends task completion messages for failed tasks only. <br></br> - If A, the LSAM sends task completion messages for all tasks. <br></br> - If N, the LSAM does not send task completion messages. <br></br> ---- If the value is "A" or "F", the process name of the failed process and as much information as possible indicating the reason for the failure are stored within the database. The HISTORY task attribute is used to provide the failure information; values returned will be integers that correspond to the HISTORYTYPE, HISTORYCAUSE, and HISTORYREASON task attributes. Because of the excessive number of possible values and combinations for the history task attributes and the overhead required in translating them, the numeric values will not be translated to mnemonics by the LSAM. The associated meanings of these values may be found in the Unisys document, "Task Attributes Programming Reference Manual". The process name and failure information are returned in separate entries immediately following the job status description entry. This information will be visible in Enterprise Manager Operation > Job Information > Configuration > Operations Related Information. |
| Send Fail/Reset message | A | - A <br></br> - F <br></br> - R <br></br> - N | This field enables/disables messaging during job processing to indicate Fail Code/Fail Reset matches. <br></br><br></br> - The LSAM sends messages to Enterprise Manager Operation. <br></br> - If A, the LSAM sends messages upon a Fail Code/Fail Reset match. <br></br> - If F, the LSAM sends messages upon a Fail Code match. <br></br> - If R, the LSAM sends messages upon a Fail Reset match. <br></br> - If N, the LSAM does not send messages upon a Fail Code or a Fail Reset match. |
| Enable Statistics | N | - Y <br></br> - N | This field determines whether to return job statistics appended to job status messages. <br></br><br></br> - If Enable Statistics is N, then statistics are not returned. <br></br> - If Enable Statistics is Y, statistics are returned. |
| Temp file family | ```<None>``` | Any valid family name | This field determines where the temporary files created by the MCP LSAM will be placed. <br></br><br></br> - If no family name is entered, the temporary files created by the MCP LSAM will be placed on the same family upon which the LSAM resides. <br></br> - If a family name is entered, temporary files created by the MCP LSAM will be placed on the specified family. |
|Freq | N | - N <br></br> - M <br></br> - U | This field determines the units of a Checkpoint Interval. Refer to [User-defined Restart/Recovery Checkpoints](../additional-features/lsam-features/user-defined-restart-checkpoints) for more information on checkpoints. <br></br><br></br> - At regular checkpoints, the LSAM saves tracking file and job array information for recovery and restart purposes. <br></br> - The automatic recovery/restart process falls back on the data from the last checkpoint. <br></br> - If N, the LSAM does not create user-defined checkpoints. <br></br> - If M, the interval unit is by minute. <br></br> - If U, the interval unit is by update to the job array. |
| Interval | 0100 | 0 – 9999 | This field sets the number of minutes/updates between checkpoints. <br></br> - If the Checkpoint Frequency is M, then the interval is the number of minutes between checkpoints. <br></br> - If the Checkpoint Frequency is U, then the interval is the number of job array updates between checkpoints. |
